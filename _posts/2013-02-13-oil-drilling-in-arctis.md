**There are large amounts of oil and gas in the Arctic Ocean. More than 5 percent of the world’s known oil resources are located there, in addition to about 25 percent of the world’s [natural gas.](http://naturvernforbundet.no/olje-og-gass-i-arktis/category2650.html) There is an enormous opportunity for Norway here; we have both the geographic and technical prerequisites needed to extract resources from the area. But should we?**

###Complicated extraction
Extraction of oil and gas in the Arctic is a risky process. The ocean floor is cold, which makes drilling difficult. Concrete and steel, which are both used in the process, become brittle at lower temperatures. The risk will therefore be greater. The Norwegian magazine [Teknisk Ukeblad](http://www.tu.no/olje-gass/2011/04/27/store-utfordringer-venter-i-arktis) puts it simply: 
“An area which cycles between being dark and very dark, has icebergs, extreme cold and a low population density, can be challenging for petroleum extraction.”  
While the extraction of oil is complicated and risky in the Arctic, the biggest problem is that there's very little one can do to stop an oil spill. The ecosystems are fragile, and the platforms will be located far from the mainland. This ensures that in the event of a potential oil spill, we probably won’t be able to get there in time to stop serious damage to the environment. The total risk will therefore always be bigger in the Arctic than in the North Sea.

###An important principle
The technological and logistical challenges are huge, but still shouldn’t be the main focus of this debate. This is a matter of principle: If Norway works for oil extraction in the Arctic Ocean, we signal to the rest of the world that we have no intention to limit our dependency on oil and gas. If the richest country in the world can’t manage to keep their hands off one of the most vulnerable areas in the world with such risk attached to it, they are not taking environmental issues seriously. 


###Important symbol
In terms of world pollution, Norwegian oil extraction is a drop in the bucket. We’re simply not big enough to matter, [compared to other countries.](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2241rank.html) That still doesn’t mean that we can do whatever we want. Norway can make an important contribution by showing initiative, as the countries that really matter in terms of pollution, have not really been willing to do much at all. If we expose ourselves as a country that doesn't care about the environment when push comes to shove, what signal does that send to the rest of the world? We can’t be an environmental pioneer if we extract oil from the Arctic Ocean. As one of the few countries who can easily afford to prioritize the environment, we will set a bad precedent by not doing so.
