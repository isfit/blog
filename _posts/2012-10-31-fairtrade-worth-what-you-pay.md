As you are sitting on campus with your thermo-cup with the Fairtrade 
tea label clearly visible, you are signalizing to the world that you are 
a responsible world citizen who is serious about your humanitarian 
responsibility. But what does the Fairtrade-label actually entail, 
other than giving the consumer a clear conscience? Is there really 
any difference between Fairtrade tea and regular tea?

In order to become a certified Fairtrade-partner, one must be approved 
by the FLO (Fairtrade International), who ensures that certain demands 
are met regarding working conditions, wages and sustainable production 
methods. In addition, Fairtrade has a list of materials that are banned 
for use in the entire organization. One can also report to the FLO 
any Fairtrade company that does not abide by FLO standards. FLO 
follows the The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
which means that no children are involved in Fairtrade prod-
uction. Everyone working for Fairtrade does so of their own 
free will. There is no room for forced labour, threats or slavery. 
In addition, the production of Fairtrade products is environ-
mentally friendly and preferably organic. Lastly, but not least: 
'Discrimination founded in political opinions, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual preferences or other is not 
tolerated.'

All this sounds great, yet there is still controversy surrounding Fairtrade. One point of critique is regarding the Fairtrade guaranteed minimum price of raw materials. This minimum price ensures decent wages and a decent price for the farmers’ products. However, a product’s value is regu ated by the market, and merchandise such as coffee has a high price fluctuation. In 2001 the marke price of coffee was below half of the Fairtrade guaranteed minimum. Therefore, Fairtrade prod ers earned more money for their coffee compared to unorganized producers. This creates an imbalan in the market, which is unfair to unorganized farms and plantations.

Maybe you are wondering why many Fairtrade products cost more than 
regular products? The idea is that the consumer is willing to pay more 
to ensure proper wages and proper working conditions for the ex-
porter. In practice, the price is higher for some Fairtrade products, 
particularly coffee and chocolate, compared to their mass-produced 
low-quality alternatives. More of the earnings reach the workers 
directly, instead of being absorbed by intermediary agents. Un-
fortunately, it is unclear how much of the income actually reaches 
the workers; this is a ratio that may vary greatly between products. 
Fairtrade products are also generally of high quality, and about 
half of the merchandise are organic. Fairtrade bananas usually 
have a higher price as the transport methods deployed by 
Fairtrade-organized plantations are not as cost-efficient as 
those of their international competitors. It should however be 
noted that Fairtrade products are not necessarily more 
expensive than the alternatives: If for instance coffee is on 
high demand, the market price will be above the Fairtrade 
minimum, making the Fairtrade coffee no more expensive 
than that of its counterparts.

Fairtrade is beneficial because it protects the rights of peasants in Asia, Africa, and Latin-
America who would otherwise be prone to unfair conditions. On the other hand, the unorganized peasants 
get no such minimum price guarantee. Should all plantations be organized as Fairtrade—or perhaps none?
